abstract = {College students are facilitated with increasingly convenient access to the Internet, which has a civilizing influence on students' learning and living. This study attempts to reveal the association between Internet usage behaviors and academic performance, and to predict undergraduate's academic performance from the usage data by machine learning. A set of features, including online duration, Internet traffic volume, and connection frequency, were extracted, calculated and normalized from the real Internet usage data of 4000 students. Three common machine learning algorithms of decision tree, neural network and support vector machine were used to predict academic performance from these features. The results indicate that behavior discipline plays a vital role in academic success. Internet connection frequency features are positively correlated with academic performance, whereas Internet traffic volume features are negatively associated with academic performance. From the perspective of the online time features, Internet time consumed results in unexpected performance between different datasets. Furthermore, as the number of features increase, prediction accuracy is generally improved in the methods. The results show that Internet usage data are capable of differentiating and predicting student's academic performance.}

abstract={This paper reports that in a classroom setting in which students were assigned traditional paper based homework, online homework, and too in-class quizzes using clickers, students believed that online homework would be the most useful component of learning. However, of the three tasks, only the in-class clicker quizzes actually correlated with test performance. The results call into questions the usefulness of assigning homework as a means of increasing student learning. Using technology in university classrooms is becoming increasingly popular. Two technologies being increasingly used are online homework managers and clickers. The online homework managers enable students to complete homework on the Internet. Clickers are devices that allow students to respond to in-class questions and communicate those answers to the instructor. This paper examines student opinions about which technology is most helpful and which technology is best in promoting learning. Publishers advertise their online homework managers as a key component of their textbook inventory and assert that they improve learning.},

Students who went to religious high schools seem to outperform their private and public school counterparts. However, the impact of this advantage is a relatively small increase (0.055–0.073) in GPA on a four-point scale. Also, the impact of going to a religious high school seems to lessen as students proceed through college, disappearing entirely by the junior and senior years.}

abstract={Although the use of the Internet is generalised, its potential as a teaching tool is rarely taken into account. At the same time, there exists a digital divide affecting vulnerable or disadvantaged groups: students of foreign origin and students with special educational needs. It is necessary to identify how inequality can be overcome to reach the objectives set by the United Nations regarding sustainable forms of development for education and to foster more inclusive and egalitarian societies. In this research with students aged 12–16, the objective was to establish profiles according to gender, social class, ethnic background and educational special needs. We used a mixed methodological design, applying a questionnaire to 2734 students from 15 centres and qualitative data collection techniques. We made a descriptive and inferential analysis (SPSS program) and a qualitative data content analysis supported by the “Maxqda” program. The results show that, although most students have Internet access, students of foreign origin and students with special educational needs use this resource less frequently. There are significant differences for gender. Likewise, social divide has an impact on the learning potential of the Internet. Some proposals for improvement are provided, from the framework of the school, with a view to improving socio-educational equity and inclusion in societies in search of a more sustainable form of development.},

abstract={Drawing on 178 video-recorded lessons from 47 lower-secondary classrooms with high technological infrastructure in Norway, the present study sheds light on how and for what purposes teachers use technology in their everyday instruction, providing important insights into what kind of digital literacy practices students experience in a classroom context. Key findings are that teachers’ implementation and uptake of technology in everyday instruction was narrow and limited. Despite good access and high national ambitions for the development of students’ digital competence, teachers’ uptake of the available digital technology was very often limited to supporting traditional teacher-centered practices, with low student participation, suggesting that information and communications technology (ICT) was used for traditional transmissive pedagogy. Teachers’ discourse around ICT in class was practical and technical, rather than conceptual. Further, students’ use of technology mainly revolved around writing digital texts, individually, not the promising pedagogical practices associated with ICT in previous research. These findings show that the implementation of digital technology and the development of digital competence in schools require far more than an ambitious curriculum and a basic digital infrastructure. Structures at a national level are not enough, and there is an urgent need for professional development at the local level to increase the instructional repertoire and the didactical motivation of teachers in relation to digital technology.},
