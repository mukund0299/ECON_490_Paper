abstract={Considerable controversy surrounds the effects technologies such as the Internet have on human capital accumulation. As with most media, the Internet and related services are capable of delivering enriched learning experiences. However, there are large potential costs to using the Internet and its concomitant services, which may result in degradation of high school students' scholastic performance. In this study, we explore two related questions. First, does Internet usage harm the grades of high school students? Second, to what degree does the intensity of Internet usage affect grades? We utilize data from the 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which measures educational outcomes, internet use and a host of other correlates. Probit results indicate that excessive Internet use lowers the probability of earning top grades while more moderate use has a positive impact on the probability.;Considerable controversy surrounds the effects technologies such as the Internet have on human capital accumulation.

abstract = {College students are facilitated with increasingly convenient access to the Internet, which has a civilizing influence on students' learning and living. This study attempts to reveal the association between Internet usage behaviors and academic performance, and to predict undergraduate's academic performance from the usage data by machine learning. A set of features, including online duration, Internet traffic volume, and connection frequency, were extracted, calculated and normalized from the real Internet usage data of 4000 students. Three common machine learning algorithms of decision tree, neural network and support vector machine were used to predict academic performance from these features. The results indicate that behavior discipline plays a vital role in academic success. Internet connection frequency features are positively correlated with academic performance, whereas Internet traffic volume features are negatively associated with academic performance. From the perspective of the online time features, Internet time consumed results in unexpected performance between different datasets. Furthermore, as the number of features increase, prediction accuracy is generally improved in the methods. The results show that Internet usage data are capable of differentiating and predicting student's academic performance.}
